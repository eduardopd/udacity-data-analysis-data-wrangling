Udacity - Project 4 - Wrangle and Analyze Data

## About this Project

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, a full Data Wrangling process was conducted. There are steps in gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data. After it, some assumptions were made. 

## Getting Started

### Why? 

Cleaning data is the first step to start analyzing. The rules of [Tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) should be followed and the result should be an assessed and cleaned data frame. 

### Files

In the project directory, there are some files. One is the Jupyter notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb), where the code is written. There are another two HTML files, related to the analysis performed during the wrangling process and about the data after the process. The other file is a CSV imported during the process of gathering. 

### Running the code

To run this project you should have a local server running with Jupyter Notebook installed (you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

The Jupyter notebook is filled with two types of cells, markdown and, code. To run the cells press shift + return and then check the results if there is any to be shown. 

### Built With 

[Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
